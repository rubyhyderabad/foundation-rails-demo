Installation
Inside your Gemfile add the following line:

		group :assets do
		  gem 'zurb-foundation', '~> 2.2'
		end

Then run bundle install to install the gem.

What now?

If you want to include Foundation on all of your application pages (and why wouldn't you!) then run the following to append foundation to your application sprockets files:

	rails g foundation:install

You can also manually include foundation on specific pages using:

stylesheet_link_tag "foundation"
javascript_include_tag "foundation"
Or add require "foundation" to your sprockets files like so:

in application.css

	/*= require "foundation" */
in application.js

	//= require "foundation"
Advanced

If you wish to be more selective about which Foundation files you'd like to use in your project that's possible too! So instead of using require "foundation" you can selectively add stylesheets and javascripts to your project like so:

in application.css

	/*
	*= require "foundation/globals"
	*= require "foundation/typography"
	*/
in application.js

	//= require "foundation/forms.jquery"
	//= require "foundation/jquery.customforms"
	//= require "foundation/app"
This gem contains the same files as the corresponding Foundation release, which currently is:

Stylesheets

globals
typography
grid
ui
forms
orbit
reveal
mobile
JavaScripts

jquery.reveal
jquery.orbit-1.3.0
forms.jquery
jquery.customforms
jquery.placeholder.min
app
Set the viewport

Finally you'll also want to add the following line to the <head> section in your layout file (i.e. app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) so the design will scale for mobile devices:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
You can also use the included generator to accomplish the same thing:

rails g foundation:layout
Using foundation in production
Before pushing your application to production, you'll need to determine how you want your assets served. You can either compile them on-the-fly or precompile them (recommended). Before continuing you'll want to check your Rails application Gemfile and ensure that gem "zurb-foundation" is included in the assets group.

To compile on-the-fly

In your Rails application edit config/application.rb and change:

Bundler.require(*Rails.groups(:assets => %w(development test)))
to:

Bundler.require(:default, :assets, Rails.env)
Then in config/environments/production.rb make sure the following setting exists:

config.assets.compile = true
Now all your assets will be compiled the first time someone visits your site, which can cause some delay. Kind of like the first time Passenger spins up your application after it has been idle for some time.

To precompile assets using Capistrano

In your Rails application edit Capfile and add the following line after load 'deploy':

load 'deploy/assets'
Now when you run cap deploy the deploy:assets:precompile task will be run which takes care of running bundle exec rake assets:precompile for you.

By default assets that are precompiled will be located in the public/assets/ folder of your application.

Why use this gem?

Easy to setup: Start using Foundation in mere seconds, like a boss
Paths: All images will work regardless of if you deploy to a sub-uri or not
Clean: Don't clutter up your assets directory
Dependencies
rails (~> 3.1)
jquery-rails (~> 1.0)
